Note [Conveying CAF-info and LFInfo between modules]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some information about an Id is generated in the code generator, and is not
available earlier.  Namely:

* CAF info.   Code motion in Cmm or earlier phases may move references around so
  we compute information about which bits of code refer to which CAF late in the
  Cmm pipeline.

* LambdaFormInfo. This records the details of a closure representation,
  including
    - the final arity (for functions)
    - whether it is a data constructor, and if so its tag

Collectively we call this CgInfo (see GHC.StgToCmm.Types).

It's very useful for importing modules to have this information. We can always
make a conservative assumption, but that is bad: e.g.

* For CAF info, if we know nothing we have to assume it is a CAF which bloats
  the SRTs of the importing module.

  Conservative assumption here is made when creating new Ids.

* For data constructors, we really like having well-tagged pointers. See #14677,
  #16559, #15155, and wiki: commentary/rts/haskell-execution/pointer-tagging

  Conservative assumption here is made when we import an Id without a
  LambdaFormInfo in the interface, in GHC.StgToCmm.Closure.mkLFImported.

So we arrange to always serialise this information into the interface file.  The
moving parts are:

* We record the CgInfo in the IdInfo of the Id.

* GHC.Driver.Pipeline: the call to updateModDetailsIdInfos augments the
  ModDetails constructed at the end of the Core pipeline, with CgInfo
  gleaned from the back end.  The hard work is done in GHC.Iface.UpdateIdInfos.

* For ModIface we generate the final ModIface with CgInfo in
  GHC.Iface.Make.mkFullIface.

* We don't absolutely guarantee to serialise the CgInfo: we won't if you have
  -fomit-interface-pragmas or -fno-code; and we won't read it in if you have
  -fignore-interface-pragmas.  (We could revisit this decision.)
