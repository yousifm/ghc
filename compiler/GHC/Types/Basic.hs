Note [OneShotInfo overview]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lambda-bound Ids (and only lambda-bound Ids) may be decorated with
one-shot info.  The idea is that if we see
    (\x{one-shot}. e)
it means that this lambda will only be applied once.  In particular
that means we can float redexes under the lambda without losing
work.  For example, consider
    let t = expensive in
    (\x{one-shot}. case t of { True -> ...; False -> ... })

Because it's a one-shot lambda, we can safely inline t, giving
    (\x{one_shot}. case <expensive> of
                       { True -> ...; False -> ... })

Moving parts:

* Usage analysis, performed as part of demand-analysis, finds
  out whether functions call their argument once.  Consider
     f g x = Just (case g x of { ... })

  Here 'f' is lazy in 'g', but it guarantees to call it no
  more than once.  So g will get a C1(U) usage demand.

* Occurrence analysis propagates this usage information
  (in the demand signature of a function) to its calls.
  Example, given 'f' above
     f (\x.e) blah

  Since f's demand signature says it has a C1(U) usage demand on its
  first argument, the occurrence analyser sets the \x to be one-shot.
  This is done via the occ_one_shots field of OccEnv.

* Float-in and float-out take account of one-shot-ness

* Occurrence analysis doesn't set "inside-lam" for occurrences inside
  a one-shot lambda

Other notes

* A one-shot lambda can use its argument many times.  To elaborate
  the example above
    let t = expensive in
    (\x{one-shot}. case t of { True -> x+x; False -> x*x })

  Here the '\x' is one-shot, which justifies inlining 't',
  but x is used many times. That's absolutely fine.

* It's entirely possible to have
     (\x{one-shot}. \y{many-shot}. e)

  For example
     let t = expensive
         g = \x -> let v = x+t in
             \y -> x + v
     in map (g 5) xs

  Here the `\x` is a one-shot binder: `g` is applied to one argument
  exactly once.  And because the `\x` is one-shot, it would be fine to
  float that `let t = expensive` binding inside the `\x`.

  But the `\y` is most definitely not one-shot!

{- Note [Precedence in types]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Many pretty-printing functions have type
    ppr_ty :: PprPrec -> Type -> SDoc

The PprPrec gives the binding strength of the context.  For example, in
   T ty1 ty2
we will pretty-print 'ty1' and 'ty2' with the call
  (ppr_ty appPrec ty)
to indicate that the context is that of an argument of a TyConApp.

We use this consistently for Type and HsType.

Note [Type operator precedence]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We don't keep the fixity of type operators in the operator. So the
pretty printer follows the following precedence order:

   TyConPrec         Type constructor application
   TyOpPrec/FunPrec  Operator application and function arrow

We have funPrec and opPrec to represent the precedence of function
arrow and type operators respectively, but currently we implement
funPrec == opPrec, so that we don't distinguish the two. Reason:
it's hard to parse a type like
    a ~ b => c * d -> e - f

By treating opPrec = funPrec we end up with more parens
    (a ~ b) => (c * d) -> (e - f)

But the two are different constructors of PprPrec so we could make
(->) bind more or less tightly if we wanted.

Note [Star kind precedence]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We parenthesize the (*) kind to avoid two issues:

1. Printing invalid or incorrect code.
   For example, instead of  type F @(*) x = x
         GHC used to print  type F @*   x = x
   However, (@*) is a type operator, not a kind application.

2. Printing kinds that are correct but hard to read.
   Should  Either * Int  be read as  Either (*) Int
                              or as  (*) Either Int  ?
   This depends on whether -XStarIsType is enabled, but it would be
   easier if we didn't have to check for the flag when reading the code.

At the same time, we cannot parenthesize (*) blindly.
Consider this Haskell98 kind:          ((* -> *) -> *) -> *
With parentheses, it is less readable: (((*) -> (*)) -> (*)) -> (*)

The solution is to assign a special precedence to (*), 'starPrec', which is
higher than 'funPrec' but lower than 'appPrec':

   F * * *   becomes  F (*) (*) (*)
   F A * B   becomes  F A (*) B
   Proxy *   becomes  Proxy (*)
   a * -> *  becomes  a (*) -> *

This is the "Embedding-Projection pair" datatype, it contains
two pieces of code (normally either RenamedExpr's or Id's)
If we have a such a pair (EP from to), the idea is that 'from' and 'to'
represents functions of type

        from :: T -> Tring
        to   :: Tring -> T

And we should have

        to (from x) = x

T and Tring are arbitrary, but typically T is the 'main' type while
Tring is the 'representation' type.  (This just helps us remember
whether to use 'from' or 'to'.

-- | Embedding Projection pair
data EP a = EP { fromEP :: a,   -- :: T -> Tring
                 toEP   :: a }  -- :: Tring -> T

{-
Embedding-projection pairs are used in several places:

First of all, each type constructor has an EP associated with it, the
code in EP converts (datatype T) from T to Tring and back again.

Secondly, when we are filling in Generic methods (in the typechecker,
tcMethodBinds), we are constructing bimaps by induction on the structure
of the type of the method signature.

Note [TailCallInfo]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The occurrence analyser determines what can be made into a join point, but it
doesn't change the binder into a JoinId because then it would be inconsistent
with the occurrences. Thus it's left to the simplifier (or to simpleOptExpr) to
change the IdDetails.

The AlwaysTailCalled marker actually means slightly more than simply that the
function is always tail-called. See Note [Invariants on join points].

This info is quite fragile and should not be relied upon unless the occurrence
analyser has *just* run. Use 'Id.isJoinId_maybe' for the permanent state of
the join-point-hood of a binder; a join id itself will not be marked
AlwaysTailCalled.

Note that there is a 'TailCallInfo' on a 'ManyOccs' value. One might expect that
being tail-called would mean that the variable could only appear once per branch
(thus getting a `OneOcc { }` occurrence info), but a join
point can also be invoked from other join points, not just from case branches:

  let j1 x = ...
      j2 y = ... j1 z {- tail call -} ...
  in case w of
       A -> j1 v
       B -> j2 u
       C -> j2 q

Here both 'j1' and 'j2' will get marked AlwaysTailCalled, but j1 will get
ManyOccs and j2 will get `OneOcc { occ_n_br = 2 }`.

{- Note [Competing activations]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sometimes a RULE and an inlining may compete, or two RULES.
See Note [Rules and inlining/other rules] in GHC.HsToCore.

We say that act1 "competes with" act2 iff
   act1 is active in the phase when act2 *becomes* active
NB: remember that phases count *down*: 2, 1, 0!

It's too conservative to ensure that the two are never simultaneously
active.  For example, a rule might be always active, and an inlining
might switch on in phase 2.  We could switch off the rule, but it does
no harm.

{- Note [InlinePragma]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This data type mirrors what you can write in an INLINE or NOINLINE pragma in
the source program.

If you write nothing at all, you get defaultInlinePragma:
   inl_inline = NoUserInlinePrag
   inl_act    = AlwaysActive
   inl_rule   = FunLike

It's not possible to get that combination by *writing* something, so
if an Id has defaultInlinePragma it means the user didn't specify anything.

If inl_inline = Inline or Inlineable, then the Id should have an InlineRule unfolding.

If you want to know where InlinePragmas take effect: Look in GHC.HsToCore.Binds.makeCorePair

Note [inl_inline and inl_act]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* inl_inline says what the user wrote: did they say INLINE, NOINLINE,
  INLINABLE, or nothing at all

* inl_act says in what phases the unfolding is active or inactive
  E.g  If you write INLINE[1]    then inl_act will be set to ActiveAfter 1
       If you write NOINLINE[1]  then inl_act will be set to ActiveBefore 1
       If you write NOINLINE[~1] then inl_act will be set to ActiveAfter 1
  So note that inl_act does not say what pragma you wrote: it just
  expresses its consequences

* inl_act just says when the unfolding is active; it doesn't say what
  to inline.  If you say INLINE f, then f's inl_act will be AlwaysActive,
  but in addition f will get a "stable unfolding" with UnfoldingGuidance
  that tells the inliner to be pretty eager about it.

Note [CONLIKE pragma]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The ConLike constructor of a RuleMatchInfo is aimed at the following.
Consider first
    {-# RULE "r/cons" forall a as. r (a:as) = f (a+1) #-}
    g b bs = let x = b:bs in ..x...x...(r x)...
Now, the rule applies to the (r x) term, because GHC "looks through"
the definition of 'x' to see that it is (b:bs).

Now consider
    {-# RULE "r/f" forall v. r (f v) = f (v+1) #-}
    g v = let x = f v in ..x...x...(r x)...
Normally the (r x) would *not* match the rule, because GHC would be
scared about duplicating the redex (f v), so it does not "look
through" the bindings.

However the CONLIKE modifier says to treat 'f' like a constructor in
this situation, and "look through" the unfolding for x.  So (r x)
fires, yielding (f (v+1)).

This is all controlled with a user-visible pragma:
     {-# NOINLINE CONLIKE [1] f #-}

The main effects of CONLIKE are:

    - The occurrence analyser (OccAnal) and simplifier (Simplify) treat
      CONLIKE thing like constructors, by ANF-ing them

    - New function GHC.Core.Utils.exprIsExpandable is like exprIsCheap, but
      additionally spots applications of CONLIKE functions

    - A CoreUnfolding has a field that caches exprIsExpandable

    - The rule matcher consults this field.  See
      Note [Expanding variables] in GHC.Core.Rules.
