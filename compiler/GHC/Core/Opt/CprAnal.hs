{- Note [Constructed Product Result]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The goal of Constructed Product Result analysis is to identify functions that
surely return heap-allocated records on every code path, so that we can
eliminate said heap allocation by performing a worker/wrapper split
(via 'GHC.Core.Opt.WorkWrap.Utils.mkWWcpr_start').

`swap` below is such a function:
```
  swap (a, b) = (b, a)
```
A `case` on an application of `swap`, like
`case swap (10, 42) of (a, b) -> a + b` could cancel away
(by case-of-known-constructor) if we \"inlined\" `swap` and simplified. We then
say that `swap` has the CPR property.

We can't inline recursive functions, but similar reasoning applies there:
```
  f x n = case n of
    0 -> (x, 0)
    _ -> f (x+1) (n-1)
```
Inductively, `case f 1 2 of (a, b) -> a + b` could cancel away the constructed
product with the case. So `f`, too, has the CPR property. But we can't really
"inline" `f`, because it's recursive. Also, non-recursive functions like `swap`
might be too big to inline (or even marked NOINLINE). We still want to exploit
the CPR property, and that is exactly what the worker/wrapper transformation
can do for us:
```
  $wf x n = case n of
    0 -> case (x, 0) of -> (a, b) -> (# a, b #)
    _ -> case f (x+1) (n-1) of (a, b) -> (# a, b #)
  f x n = case $wf x n of (# a, b #) -> (a, b)
```
where $wf readily simplifies (by case-of-known-constructor and inlining `f`) to:
```
  $wf x n = case n of
    0 -> (# x, 0 #)
    _ -> $wf (x+1) (n-1)
```
Now, a call site like `case f 1 2 of (a, b) -> a + b` can inline `f` and
eliminate the heap-allocated pair constructor.

Note [Nested CPR]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We can apply Note [Constructed Product Result] deeper than just the outer
constructor of a function, e.g.,
```
  g x
    | even x = (x,  x+1) :: (Int, Int)
    | odd  x = (x+1,x+2)
```
we certainly would want to nestedly unbox the second component of the pair!
Indeed we can give that second component the CPR property. We can even unbox
the first component, because `x` is used strictly and thus will be unboxed
(see Note [CPR for binders that will be unboxed]). We get
```
  $wg (x :: Int#)
    | .. x .. = (# x,       x +# 1# #) :: (# Int#, Int# #)
    | .. x .. = (# x +# 1#, x +# 2# #)
  g (I# x) = case $wf x of (# y, z #) -> (I# y, I# z)
```
Nice.

Note [Nested CPR needs Termination information]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
But careful! If we follow Note [Nested CPR] blindly, we would nestedly unbox
`h1` below to get `h2`:
```
  h1 x = (x+1, x+2)
  h2 x = case $wh2 x of (# y, z #) -> (I# y, I# z)
  $wh2 (I# x) = (# x +# 1#, x +# 2# #)
```
Note that `h2` is strict in `x`, whereas `h1` isn't. That is unsound, as
it changes semantics of ``h1 (error "boom") `seq` 42`` from returning 42 to
crashing. Thus, we musn't unbox and Nested CPR feeds on elaborate termination
information that says for `g` \"Both components of the pair terminate rapidly
when evaluated\".

The termination information is computed by an analysis that shares the same
general structure as Nested CPR, hence it makes sense to interleave both. The
fact that the analysis is parameterised over instances of 'ForwardLattice',
rather than specialised to its concrete instantiations 'Term' and 'CAT' (CPR
and Term), is a testament to that structural similarity. It's well possible
to call the analysis for termination information only in the future, to serve
as a higher-order 'exprOkForSpeculation' on steroids.

Note [Phase ordering]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We need to perform strictness analysis before CPR analysis, because that might
unbox some arguments, in turn leading to more constructed products.
Ideally, we would want the following pipeline:

1. Strictness
2. worker/wrapper (for strictness)
3. Termination+CPR
4. worker/wrapper (for CPR)

Currently, we omit 2. and anticipate the results of worker/wrapper.
See Note [CPR for binders that will be unboxed]
and Note [CPR in a DataAlt case alternative].
An additional w/w pass would simplify things, but probably add slight overhead.
So currently we have

1. Strictness
2. Termination+CPR
3. worker/wrapper (for strictness and CPR)

{- Note [Arity trimming for CPR signatures]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Although it doesn't affect correctness of the analysis per se, we have to trim
CPR signatures to idArity. Here's what might happen if we don't:

  f x = if expensive
          then \y. Box y
          else \z. Box z
  g a b = f a b

The two lambdas will have a CPR type of @1m@ (so construct a product after
applied to one argument). Thus, @f@ will have a CPR signature of @2m@
(constructs a product after applied to two arguments).
But WW will never eta-expand @f@! In this case that would amount to possibly
duplicating @expensive@ work.

(Side note: Even if @f@'s 'idArity' happened to be 2, it would not do so, see
Note [Don't eta expand in w/w].)

So @f@ will not be worker/wrappered. But @g@ also inherited its CPR signature
from @f@'s, so it *will* be WW'd:

  f x = if expensive
          then \y. Box y
          else \z. Box z
  $wg a b = case f a b of Box x -> x
  g a b = Box ($wg a b)

And the case in @g@ can never cancel away, thus we introduced extra reboxing.
Hence we always trim the CPR signature of a binding to idArity.

Note [Trimming CPR signatures according to Term]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider

  f :: Int -> Maybe Int
  f n = Just (sum [0..n]) -- assume that `sum` has the CPR property
  g :: Int -> Int
  g n | n < 0     = n
      | otherwise = case f n of Just blah -> blah

For the RHS of 'f', we infer the CPR type `1->#c2(*c1(#))`. That is enough to
unbox the 'Just' constructor, but not the nested 'I#' constructor, which would
evaluate the expensive `sum` expression. So we give 'f' the CPR signature
`1->#c2(*)`, which inhibits WW from unboxing the 'I#'.

Why not do the trimming in WW? Because then we might get CPR where we wouldn't
expect it, like 'g' above. If we gave 'f' the CPR sig `1->#c2(*c1(#))`, then
'blah' would have the CPR type `*c1(#)`. In total, 'g' would have the CPR sig
`1->*c1(*)` and WW would unbox it, but the `case` on `f` would never cancel
away and we'd rebox the `Int` returned from 'f'.

Note [Improving CPR by considering strictness demand from call sites]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider `T18894`:

  module T18894 (h) where
  g :: Int -> Int -> (Int,Int)
  g !m 1 = (2 + m, 0)
  g m  n = (2 * m, 2 `div` n)
  h :: Int -> Int
  h 1 = 0
  h m | odd m     = snd (g m 2)
      | otherwise = uncurry (+) (g 2 m)

We infer CPR type `2->#c1(#c1(*), *c1(*))` for 'g's RHS and by
Note [Trimming CPR signatures according to Term] we *should* trim that to
`2->c1(c1(*), *))` for the CPR signature, because unboxing the division might in
fact diverge and throw a div-by-zero exception.

But if you look at how 'g' is called, you'll see that all call sites evaluate
the second component of the returned pair anyway! So acutally it would have been
OK to unbox the division, because all call sites force it anyway.

Demand analysis infers a demand of `UCU(CS(P(1P(U),SP(U))))` on 'g'. Note how
it says that all call sites evaluate the second component of the pair! We use
that to improve the termination information with which we trim CPR, as if we
had inferred `2->#c1(#c1(*), #c1(*))` instead, to get CPR `2->c1(c1(*),c1(*))`
and unbox both components of the pair.

{- Note [Ensuring termination of fixed-point iteration]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Fixed-point iteration may fail to terminate for a function like repeat:

  repeat x = x : repeat x

In the first  round, we will infer the Cpr 2(-, -).
In the second round, we will infer the Cpr 2(-, 2(-, -)).
And so on.

Hence it is important to apply a /widening/ operator between iterations to
ensure termination. In the case of DmdAnal, that is simply a check on the
number of iterations, defaulting to Top after a certain limit
(See Note [Safe abortion in the fixed-point iteration] in DmdAnal).
In case of CprAnal, we simply prune Cpr and Term info after each
iteration to a constant depth of mAX_DEPTH.

Note [CPR for binders that will be unboxed]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If a lambda-bound variable will be unboxed by worker/wrapper (so it must be
demanded strictly), then give it the CPR property. Here's a concrete example
('f1' in test T10482a), assuming h is strict:

  f1 :: Int -> Int
  f1 x = case h x of
          A -> x
          B -> f1 (x-1)
          C -> x+1

If we notice that 'x' is used strictly, we can give it the CPR
property; and hence f1 gets the CPR property too.  It's sound (doesn't
change strictness) to give it the CPR property because by the time 'x'
is returned (case A above), it'll have been evaluated (by the wrapper
of 'h' in the example).

Moreover, if f itself is strict in x, then we'll pass x unboxed to
f1, and so the boxed version *won't* be available; in that case it's
very helpful to give 'x' the CPR property. Otherwise, the worker would
*rebox* 'x' before returning it.

Note that we only want to do this for something that we want to unbox
('wantToUnboxArg'), else we may get over-optimistic CPR results
(e.g. from \x -> x!).

In practice, we derive CPR information directly from the strictness signature
and the argument type in 'cprAnalBind' via 'argCATsFromStrictSig'.

Note [Rapid termination for strict binders]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Evaluation of any strict binder will rapidly terminate once strictness
worker/wrapper has happened. Here's an example:

  g :: Int -> Int -> (Int, Int)
  g x | x > 0     = (x, x)
      | otherwise = (0, 0)

We want to nestedly unbox the components of the constructed pair, but we
may only do so if we can prove that 'x' terminates rapidly. And indeed it
does! As strictness analysis will tell, 'g' would eval 'x' anyway, so it
is OK to regard 'x' as if it terminates rapidly, because any additional
evaluation beyond the first one will. We get

  g (I# x) = case $wg x of (# a, b #) -> (I# a, I# b)
  $wg x | x ># 0#   = (# x, x #)
        | otherwise = (# 0#, 0# #)

Like for Note [CPR for binders that will be unboxed], we derive
termination information directly from the strictness signature
in 'cprAnalBind' via 'argCATsFromStrictSig'.

But in contrast to CPR information, we also have to account for termination of
strict arguments at *call sites* of 'g'! For example

  h :: Int -> ((Int, Int), (Int, Int))
  h z = (g z, g 42)

We saw that 'g' can be unboxed nestedly. And we'd even say that calls to 'g'
itself terminate rapidly, provided its argument 'x' terminates.
Now, can we unbox the pair returned by 'h' nestedly? No! Evaluating
`h (error "boom")` will terminate just fine, but not if we decide to
unbox the first component of 'h'. The key is that we have to uphold
the "provided its argument terminates" precondition at call sites of 'g'.
That clearly is not the case for 'z', which is a lazy binder.

The solution is to "force" 'z' according to the strictness
signature of 'g', which is what 'cprTransformSig' does. It
accounts the TermFlag resulting from the forcing to
the termination recorded in the signature, as if there was
a case expression forcing the argument before the call. In
case of 'g', we get that it MightDiverge because forcing of
the argument 'z' MightDiverge.

Why not simply say that 'g' MightDiverge, so that we don't have to be smart at
call sites? Because then we don't get to see that *any* function that uses its
arguments terminates rapidly! In particular, we'd miss to unbox `g 42` above,
which is perfectly within limits; evaluation of `42` terminates rapidly and then
so does the call `g 42`, which allows to unbox the second component of 'h', thus

  h z = case $wh z of
    (# p, a, b #) -> (p, (I# a, I# b))
  $wh z = case $wg 42 of
    (# a, b #) -> (# g z, a, b #)

Note [CPR in a DataAlt case alternative]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In a case alternative, we want to give some of the binders the CPR property.
Specifically

 * The case binder. Inside the alternative, the case binder always has
   the CPR property if the scrutinee has it, meaning that a case on it will
   successfully cancel. Example:
     f x = case x of y { I# x' -> if x' ==# 3
                                     then y
                                     else I# 8 }

   Since 'x' is used strictly, it will be unboxed and given the CPR property
   (See Note [CPR for binders that will be unboxed]).
   By giving 'y' the CPR property, we ensure that 'f' does too, so we get
        f (I# x) = I# (fw x)
        fw x = case x of y { I# x' -> if x' ==# 3 then x' else 8 }

   If the scrutinee has the CPR property, giving it to the case binder will
   never introduce reboxing. We used to be more optimistic before Nested CPR;
   see #19232.

 * The field binders. If the scrutinee had nested CPR information, the field
   binders inherit that information.
   Example (adapted from T10482a):
        f2 t = case t of (x, y)
                 | x<0 -> f2 (MkT2 x (y-1))
                 | y>1 -> 1
                 | otherwise -> x
   Since 'f2' is strict in 't' and even 'x', they will be available unboxed-only.
   Note [CPR for binders that will be unboxed] gives 't' an appropriately nested
   CPR property from which the field binder 'x' inherits its CPR property in turn,
   so that we give 'f2' the CPR property. Implementation in 'extendEnvForDataAlt'.

Note [CPR for sum types]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is out of date since we have join points. See #16570
At the moment we do not do CPR for let-bindings that
   * non-top level
   * bind a sum type
Reason: I found that in some benchmarks we were losing let-no-escapes,
which messed it all up.  Example
   let j = \x. ....
   in case y of
        True  -> j False
        False -> j True
If we w/w this we get
   let j' = \x. ....
   in case y of
        True  -> case j' False of { (# a #) -> Just a }
        False -> case j' True of { (# a #) -> Just a }
Notice that j' is not a let-no-escape any more.

However this means in turn that the *enclosing* function
may be CPR'd (via the returned Justs).  But in the case of
sums, there may be Nothing alternatives; and that messes
up the sum-type CPR.

Conclusion: only do this for products.  It's still not
guaranteed OK for products, but sums definitely lose sometimes.

Note [CPR for thunks]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If the rhs is a thunk, we usually forget the CPR info, because
it is presumably shared (else it would have been inlined, and
so we'd lose sharing if w/w'd it into a function).  E.g.

        let r = case expensive of
                  (a,b) -> (b,a)
        in ...

If we marked r as having the CPR property, then we'd w/w into

        let $wr = \() -> case expensive of
                            (a,b) -> (# b, a #)
            r = case $wr () of
                  (# b,a #) -> (b,a)
        in ...

But now r is a thunk, which won't be inlined, so we are no further ahead.
But consider

        f x = let r = case expensive of (a,b) -> (b,a)
              in if foo r then r else (x,x)

Does f have the CPR property?  Well, no.

However, if the strictness analyser has figured out (in a previous
iteration) that it's strict, then we DON'T need to forget the CPR info.
Instead we can retain the CPR info and do the thunk-splitting transform
(see WorkWrap.splitThunk).

This made a big difference to PrelBase.modInt, which had something like
        modInt = \ x -> let r = ... -> I# v in
                        ...body strict in r...
r's RHS isn't a value yet; but modInt returns r in various branches, so
if r doesn't have the CPR property then neither does modInt
Another case I found in practice (in Complex.magnitude), looks like this:
                let k = if ... then I# a else I# b
                in ... body strict in k ....
(For this example, it doesn't matter whether k is returned as part of
the overall result; but it does matter that k's RHS has the CPR property.)
Left to itself, the simplifier will make a join point thus:
                let $j k = ...body strict in k...
                if ... then $j (I# a) else $j (I# b)
With thunk-splitting, we get instead
                let $j x = let k = I#x in ...body strict in k...
                in if ... then $j a else $j b
This is much better; there's a good chance the I# won't get allocated.

But what about botCpr? Consider
    lvl = error "boom"
    fac -1 = lvl
    fac 0 = 1
    fac n = n * fac (n-1)
fac won't have the CPR property here when we trim every thunk! But the
assumption is that error cases are rarely entered and we are diverging anyway,
so WW doesn't hurt.

Should we also trim CPR on DataCon application bindings?
See Note [CPR for data structures]!

Note [CPR for data structures]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Long static data structures (whether top-level or not) like

  xs = x1 : xs1
  xs1 = x2 : xs2
  xs2 = x3 : xs3

should not get CPR signatures (#18154), because they

  * Never get WW'd, so their CPR signature should be irrelevant after analysis
    (in fact the signature might even be harmful for that reason)
  * Would need to be inlined/expanded to see their constructed product
  * Recording CPR on them blows up interface file sizes and is redundant with
    their unfolding. In case of Nested CPR, this blow-up can be quadratic!
    Reason: the CPR info for xs1 contains the CPR info for xs; the CPR info
    for xs2 contains that for xs1. And so on.

Hence we don't analyse or annotate data structures in 'cprAnalBind'. To
implement this, the isDataStructure guard is triggered for bindings that satisfy

  (1a) idArity id == 0   (otherwise it's a function)
  (1b) not (isJoinId id) (otherwise it counts as a function)
  (2) exprIsHNF rhs      (otherwise it's a thunk, Note [CPR for thunks] applies)

But we can't just stop giving DataCon application bindings the CPR *property*,
for example

  fac 0 = I# 1#
  fac n = n * fac (n-1)

fac certainly has the CPR property and should be WW'd! But FloatOut will
transform the first clause to

  lvl = I# 1#
  fac 0 = lvl

If lvl doesn't have the CPR property, fac won't either. But lvl is a data
structure, and hence (see above) will not have a CPR signature. So instead, when
'cprAnal' meets a variable lacking a CPR signature to extrapolate into a CPR
transformer, 'cprTransform' instead tries to get its unfolding (via
'cprDataStructureUnfolding_maybe'), and analyses that instead.

In practice, GHC generates a lot of (nested) TyCon and KindRep bindings, one
for each data declaration. They should not have CPR signatures (blow up!).

There is a perhaps surprising special case: KindRep bindings satisfy
'isDataStructure' (so no CPR signature), but are marked NOINLINE at the same
time (see the noinline wrinkle in Note [Grand plan for Typeable]). So there is
no unfolding for 'cprDataStructureUnfolding_maybe' to look through and we'll
return topCprType. And that is fine! We should refrain to look through NOINLINE
data structures in general, as a constructed product could never be exposed
after WW.

It's also worth pointing out how ad-hoc this is: If we instead had

    f1 x = x:[]
    f2 x = x : f1 x
    f3 x = x : f2 x
    ...

we still give every function an every deepening CPR signature. But it's very
uncommon to find code like this, whereas the long static data structures from
the beginning of this Note are very common because of GHC's strategy of ANF'ing
data structure RHSs.

Note [CPR for DataCon wrappers]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We treat DataCon wrappers simply by analysing their unfolding. Why not analyse
the unfolding once, upfront? Two reasons:

  1. It's simpler to analyse the unfolding anew at every call site, and the
     unfolding will be pretty cheap to analyse.
  2. The CPR sig we would give the wrapper in 'GHC.Types.Id.Make.mkDataConRep'
     would not take into account whether the arguments to the wrapper had the
     CPR property itself! That would make the CPR transformers derived from
     CPR sigs for DataCon wrappers much less precise than the transformer for
     DataCon workers ('cprTransformDataConWork').

Note [Why must AnalEnv carry StrictSigs?]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Termination analysis depends on accurate strictness signatures at *call sites*.
But termination analysis directly follows demand analysis! That means, the
'idStrictness' of 'Var' uses won't have been updated yet, because there was no
intermittent run of occurrence analysis.
Solution: Track 'idStrictness' from the binding site in 'ae_sigs'.
